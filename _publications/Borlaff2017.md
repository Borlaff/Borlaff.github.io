excerpt: 'During my PhD, following up the work presented in Masters thesis, we identified a sample of anti-truncated S0 galaxies beyond the local Universe, using HST/ACS GOODS-North cosmological field images. We found that despite the high spatial resolution of HST, the point spread function (PSF) can distort the structure of the outskirts of galaxies. To avoid this effect, we deconvolved each object using a dedicated hybrid PSF model of the ACS camera of HST. We identified 14 Type-III S0 galaxies between 0.2 < z < 0.6 (Borlaff et al. 2017), which is the furthest sample of this type of galaxies up-to-date. <br> <a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2017/08/aa30282-16.pdf"><img src="https://borlaff.github.io/files/goodsn1.png" width="800">'
