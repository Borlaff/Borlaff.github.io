I am an PhD student at the **Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias** (IAC Resident Astrophysicists PhD Programme). I have an extensive background in **galactic and extragalactic research**. I am skilled in **data analysis** and **statistics**. My main field of work is **observational methods** and **image processing**, specially from space telescopes (Hubble Space Telescope). 

I have participated in more than 50 observing nights in four observatories, **including the commisioning, support and operations** of multiple astronomical instruments at the **William Herschel Telescope (WHT)** and the **Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC)** at the Observatory of Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma). 

I am aiming to participate in the **development of space science missions**.
