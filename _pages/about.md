I am a **NASA STA Researcher ** at the Ames Research Center, in California, USA. I am a member of **European Space Agency** next flagship mission, the Euclid space telescope. In addition, I am a member of the NASA/DLR SOFIA Legacy Program for the study of Magnetic Fields in Galaxies, and the author of the FIR map of the magnetic field in M51 [(press, NASA, APOD)](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/magnetic-chaos-hidden-within-the-whirlpool-galaxy/). I finished my PhD at the **Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias** (IAC Resident Astrophysicists PhD Programme 2014), focusing in the development of new in-orbit calibration methods for the **Hubble Space Telescope**, creating the deepest image of the Universe ever done from space [(press, 2019)](https://www.space.com/43147-hubble-telescope-deepest-universe-view-photo.html). I have an extensive background in **galactic and extragalactic research**. I am skilled in **data analysis** and **statistics**. My main field of work is **observational methods** and **image processing**, specially from space telescopes (Hubble Space Telescope). 

I have participated in more than 50 observing nights in four observatories, including the **commisioning, support and operations** of multiple astronomical instruments at the **William Herschel Telescope** (WHT) and the **Gran Telescopio Canarias** (GTC) at the Observatory of Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma), and the **NASA/DLR Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)**.
