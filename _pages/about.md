I am a **NASA Postdoctoral Fellow** at the Ames Research Center, in California, USA. I am a collaborator with the **European Space Agency** for the Legacy Science program of the Euclid mission. I finished my PhD at the **Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias** (IAC Resident Astrophysicists PhD Programme 2014). I have an extensive background in **galactic and extragalactic research**. I am skilled in **data analysis** and **statistics**. My main field of work is **observational methods** and **image processing**, specially from space telescopes (Hubble Space Telescope). 

I have participated in more than 50 observing nights in four observatories, including the **commisioning, support and operations** of multiple astronomical instruments at the **William Herschel Telescope** (WHT) and the **Gran Telescopio Canarias** (GTC) at the Observatory of Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma). 

I am interested in everything about space exploration, science and technologies.
