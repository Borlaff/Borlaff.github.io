excerpt: 'In this paper we analyse the photometric and structural properties of the first sample of lenticular galaxies with Type-III profiles obtained in Borlaff et al. (2017), corrected for PSF effects, beyond the local Universe (at 0.2 < z < 0.6). We found that the general structure of Type-III S0 galaxies does not present a significant change, although they do show a brightness dimming of ∼1.5 magnitudes since z∼0.6. These observations pose strong constraints to the proposed evolutionary models of this type of galaxies, ruling out high-redshift monolithic collapse as the main scenario for the formation of Type-III S0 galaxies.'
