excerpt: 'In this work we present **ABYSS**, a new reduction of the near-infrared observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with the WFC3/IR of the Hubble Space Telescope. As a result, we successfully recover the outskirts of galaxies, increasing the depth of the HUDF by reducing the systematic biases. This new version of the HUDF recovers the light around massive galaxies to an unprecedented detail. We conclude that these methods can be highly beneficial for many future space missions, such as JWST and Euclid.
