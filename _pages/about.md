I am an astrophysicist with a large background in galactic and extragalactic research. I am skilled in data analysis and statistics and instrumentation. My main field of work is observational methods and image processing. I have participated in more than 50 observing nights in four observatories, including the commisioning, support and operations of multiple astronomical instruments at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) and the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) at the Observatory of Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma). I am aiming to participate in the development of space science missions.
